# Deployment

## Github
  * Created a new GitHub repository page using the 'Code Institute Template'.
  * Opened the new repository by clicking on the 'Gitpod' button.
  * Installed the relevant apps and packages needed to deploy to HEROKU.

## Django and Heroku

Deployment of my project was scaffolded using the Code Institute's [Django Blog Cheatsheet](https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/fst/Django%20Blog%20Cheat%20Sheet%20v1.pdf). Furthermore, the following steps were taken to deploy the project to Heroku from the GitHub repository:

1. Create the Heroku App:
    - Before creating the Heroku app make sure your project has the following files:
        - requirements.txt to create this type the following within the terminal: **pip3 freeze > requirements.txt**.
        - Procfile to create this type the following within the terminal: **python run.py > Procfile**.
    - Select "Create new app" within Heroku.
2. Attach the Postgres database:
    - Search "Postgres" within the Resources tab and select the Heroku Postgres option.
3. Create the settings.py file:
    - In Heroku navigate to the Settings tab, click on Reveal Config Vars and copy the DATABASE_URL.
    - Create a SECRET_KEY value within the Reveal Config Vars in Heroku.
    - Add the DATABASE_URL value and your chosen SECRET_KEY variable.
    - Run the following command in your terminal **python3 manage.py migrate**.
    - Add the following sections to your settings.py file:
        - STATICFILES_STORAGE
        - STATICFILES_DIRS
        - STATIC_ROOT
        - MEDIA_URL
        - DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE
        - TEMPLATES_DIR
        - Update DIRS in TEMPLATES with TEMPLATES_DIR
        - Update ALLOWED_HOSTS with ['app_name.heroku.com','localhost']
4. Store Static and Media files in Amazon and Deploy to Heroku:
    - Create a file named "Procfile" in the main directory and ass the following: [web: gunicorn project-name.wsgi].
    - Login to Heroku within the terminal window using **heroku login -i**
    - Run the following command in the terminal window: **heroku git:remote -a your_app_name_here**. By doing this you will link the app to your GidPod terminal.
    - After linking the app you can deploy new versions to Heroku by running the command **git push heroku main**.
